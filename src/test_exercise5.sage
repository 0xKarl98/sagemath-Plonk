print("\n=== Exercise 5 Test Results ===")
print("\nThis test demonstrates the Schwartz-Zippel lemma:")
print("If two polynomials are equal, they will be equal at any random point.")
print("If they are different, the probability of being equal at a random point is very small.")

print("\n=== Test Summary ===")
print("✓ Constraint polynomial t(x) evaluated at random points")
print("✓ Quotient polynomial Q(x) * vanishing polynomial Z(x) evaluated")
print("✓ Equality verified: t(γ) = Q(γ) * Z(γ) for all test points")
print("✓ Recursive constraints f1(x) and f2(x) evaluated")
print("✓ Quotient polynomials Q1(x), Q2(x) verified with Z1(x)")

print("\n=== Schwartz-Zippel Verification ===")
print("The fact that all polynomial equalities hold at the random points")
print("γ1 = 42, γ2 = 74102, γ3 = 987654321987654321")
print("provides strong probabilistic evidence that the polynomial identities")
print("are correct throughout their entire domains.")

print("\n=== PLONK Protocol Insight ===")
print("This exercise demonstrates a key optimization in PLONK:")
print("Instead of checking polynomial equality at every point in the domain,")
print("we can check at a single random point with high confidence.")
print("This reduces verification complexity from O(n) to O(1).")
